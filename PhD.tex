\section*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank the University of Winnipeg's Physics Department for fostering a supportive and intellectually challenging environment during my graduate studies. I am a better researcher and person for knowing the faculty, staff, and students there. \newline \\
I would also like to specifically thank my supervisor, Andrew Frey, for guiding my development as a researcher through both my MSc and PhD. Because of him, I have been lucky enough to pursue my dream of studying physics. \newline \\
My family -- mother Lori, father Kevin, and brothers Alex, Matthew, and Jon -- have been the bedrock of my support for my entire life, and I am eternally grateful and humbled by their encouragement and patience during my studies. I am also incredibly lucky to have many amazing friends that have always believed in me. Dani, Becky, and Danielle: thank you from the bottom of my heart. \newline \\
Most of all, I would like to thank my wife Kyla, for the faith she has in me and for the many ways that she lights up my life.

\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

The gravitational collapse of a minimally coupled scalar field in ($d + 1$)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime is examined via a collection of manuscripts that are, or are in the process of, being published. First, the results of the numerical evolution of the $5$-dimensional nonlinear Einstein equations are used to construct a phase diagram of collapse behaviours, taking the mass and width of the initial profile as parameters. Next, we test the limits of a family of perturbative solutions for massless scalars with static boundary conditions in AdS$_4$. Finally, we derive set of flow equations for the time evolution of a massive scalar field in the perturbative description of AdS$_4$ with time-dependent boundary conditions.
